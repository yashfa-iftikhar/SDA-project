Frontend of AUTOHIRE system using HTML,CSS
Our project, "AutoHire," is here to transform how companies hire new team members.
Hiring isn't easy, but AutoHire makes it simpler and fairer.
It's all about giving every candidate an equal chance.
AutoHire uses smart technology to check things like confidence, problem-solving, and communication skills.
With AutoHire, companies can choose to automate interviews completely or just certain parts.
No more worrying about favoritism â€“ AutoHire takes that out of the equation.
If a company wants to chat with candidates face-to-face, AutoHire can do that too with live video interviews.
We've also made sure candidates can't cheat by copying answers from the internet.
AutoHire keeps everything in one tab during the interview, so there's no sneaky Googling.
It's like having your own personal hiring assistant, making the process smoother and more reliable.
